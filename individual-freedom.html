                    In 2016, a person from the region known as New Zealand was detained in the region known as Kazakhstan because local authorities believed that New Zealand was not an actual country, and that the NZ passport was fake. When they were asked to bring a world map in order to be shown where NZ was, it turned out that the map did not have NZ on it. The person from NZ eventually had to bribe "the right people" in order to be allowed to leave.

                    I have been to many shops in India and have not yet found a shop that sells more than one kind of globe or world map... especially those that label countries not as Finland, Norway, Germany but as Suomi, Norge, Deutschland. The former labels are coined by "outsiders" and the latter by locals in their respective native languages.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    On one hand, the difference in labels or terminology may not matter much in some contexts. On the other hand, people often forget about variations and become attached to the version they were most exposed to, potentially downplaying or rejecting knowledge they did not already possess.

                    The dangers of such (wilfull) ignorance can be witnessed throughout history especially as a result of mistranslations or misinterpretations of r*ligious texts or "teachings."

                    is "a mental and emotional response in which a captive (e.g., a hostage) displays seeming loyalty to—even affection for—the captor. The captive may come to see law enforcement or rescuers as the enemy because they endanger the captor."

                    Nietzsche saw clearly how the displacement of r*ligion would impact humanity, and his insight was that people would enslave themselves to the st*te instead of using the opportunity to gain freedom.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    There are potentially infinite perspectives, and no single perspective is absolute or the whole truth. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    R*ligion ruined socieities for many centuries and eventually st*te began to take the lead around 18th century.

                    The "education" industry is controlled by p*liticians and the p*liticians are el*cted by "common people" because we are allegedly a dEmOcRaCy.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    For a healthy dem*cracy, you need education grounded on integrity which means the inclusion of and respect for all perspectives. Does your education system, especially your teachers, provide positive interpretations for all elements and perspectives or do they censor or disrespect any element or worldview, especially those related to the nature of a human being such as sexuality or other bodily functions?

                    An easy way to identify a bad or unhealthy system is to look for taboos. The presence of taboos is evidence that a society has to develop.

                    The road to hell is often paved with good intentions. If you wonder what the worst is that could happen, an investigation of history will give you more examples than you can perhaps bear to know about.

                    Many people claim blindly that it was "wrong" for Nazis to kill Jews but they do not understand enough how the circumstance came to be or how the genocidal acts were justified. More importantly, they do not realise how similar their own systems are with those of Nazi Germany.

                    Ultimately, individuals should be prioritised above any and all institutions or systems. If an individual is not allowed to or is unable to fulfill their potential as a human being, the institutions or systems are in need of correction.
