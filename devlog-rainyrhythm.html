                    This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. Since the theme "Siesta" refers to
                    relaxation, I wanted to make a game that offers a relaxing experience for the players. This was the
                    first time that I worked on a rhythm based game.

                    The scripts and the development process are significantly different in a rhythm based game.

                    In most games, you write the script in such a way as to synchronise the game objects and other
                    elements with the frame rate in order to maintain consistency in gameplay experience. In a rhythm
                    game, however, syncing the game elements with the frame rate causes the gameplay to lose
                    synchronisation with the music.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of connecting with delta time, some of the game elements were coupled with real time clock
                    to maintain consistency, especially in the scrolling speed of the arrows.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    The arrows carry trigger boxes to check for the overlapping of the appropriate arrows. The box sizes
                    are relatively large in size so that the players may not feel pressured to achieve pixel perfect
                    accuracy in a game about relaxation.

                    Royalty free music was used for Ode to Joy and the sound of rain. If the player misses too many
                    beats, the rain slowly fades and the sky becomes bright and clear.
                    Owlbert the workaholic owl wakes up from his nap and flies off to work. In order to keep the game
                    less
                    punishing, I kept the music playing and the arrows scrolling so that the players may still continue
                    playing and enjoy the music.

                    Krita was used to draw the owl and the background. The owl in the rainy scene is a different game
                    object from the owl that flies off if the rain stops. I used two different objects in order to make
                    it convenient to script its behaviour.
