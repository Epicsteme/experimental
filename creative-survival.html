            <p class="lh-lg">
              In<em> The Last Messiah</em>, Peter Wessel Zapffe discusses the
              human condition and our struggle with the awareness of existence.
              He argues that humans suffer because their strong thinking ability and
              self-awareness make them realize life is meaningless, pointless,
              and the fact that death is unavoidable. To cope with this existential
              anxiety, Zapffe identifies four main defense mechanisms that
              people use to suppress these difficult truths. This article
              discusses these four mechanisms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="lh-lg fw-bold">Isolation</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Isolation means pushing away or not thinking about painful or
              scary thoughts. In everyday life, people usually avoid talking
              about heavy topics like death to keep things comfortable and easy.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              This only works for a little while. The real problem doesn't go
              away; it just hides inside. Later on, these thoughts can come back
              even stronger, which might cause serious stress or emotional
              problems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="lh-lg fw-bold">Attachment</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Attachment means holding on to things that feel safe and familiar,
              like family, home, or beliefs. These attachments make us feel
              secure and help protect us from scary or hard realities. But when
              these attachments fall apart, people can feel lost, worried, or
              even depressed. To keep life stable, people build systems like
              religion, laws, and traditions that act like walls holding
              everything together.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Attachment can be fragile because it's often based on beliefs that
              aren't fully true or on hopeful thinking. When real life
              challenges these beliefs, a person's feeling of safety can fall
              apart, which may lead to a crisis or deep sadness.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="lh-lg fw-bold">Diversion</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Diversion means staying busy all the time with activities like
              work, watching TV, or hanging out with friends. People use
              diversion to avoid thinking about things that upset them. It's
              like a plane that has to keep flying; if it stops, it will crash.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Diversion can help for a little while, but it doesn't solve the
              real problem. When the distractions stop, the person is still left
              with the same hard questions. Relying too much on distractions can
              make life feel shallow, because people avoid facing important
              issues and miss out on deeper meaning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="lh-lg fw-bold">Sublimation</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Sublimation is different from the other three because it turns
              pain into something positive, like art. It helps people face
              life's problems but change their meaning into something valuable
              or beautiful. This works best if the pain isn't too overwhelming
              or if the person deals with it before feeling hopeless. Artists
              are good examples of people who use sublimation.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Through sublimation, people can turn their personal struggles into
              chances to grow instead of just hiding or ignoring their pain.
              From both a philosophical and psychological view, sublimation is
              the healthiest and most mature way to deal with life's hard
              realities.
