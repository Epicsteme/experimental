                    Students learn by connecting new knowledge with knowledge and concepts that they already know, thereby constructing new meanings.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    When I was teaching about water resources, the word "regulate" came up and the students didn't know
                    what it meant. I then pointed to the fan regulator on the wall and asked them what it was and what
                    it did. The students explained that it was the fan regulator and that it controlled the fan.
                    I pointed out that it was used to regulate the fan. I then asked them what it meant to regulate water.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Since they saw and used the fan every day, they had a schema for the fan and its
                    regulator. I used their existing schema (fan regulation) to help them build a new schema (water
                    regulation).
