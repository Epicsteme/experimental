                    This is not an act of discrimination, defamation, or false claims- these are facts and the truth
                    needs
                    to be acknowledged.
                    The purpose of this post is to spread awareness of the cruelties and injustice that took place in
                    schools and colleges in at least some regions in the near past; and to help justify my state of
                    health
                    (This post is
                    also a bit of cry for help) I was never against learning nor did I ever act in ways that could be
                    considered wrong by any
                    healthy adult. I have studied in many schools in many places since my parent's
                    job required them to move around often. Most of my teachers made me feel unsafe and unmotivated. I
                    hold these people responsible for my failures... not my failures- they have always been my teachers'
                    failures. Note that not all teachers
                    are incompetent - some teachers take
                    their responsibilities seriously and their commitment should be acknowledged and appreciated.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the primary schools I have been to was St Johns EM
                    School in Tenali. Some of the teachers that I had back then lacked the interpersonal skills
                    necessary to teach a child in a healthy manner which could allow the child to grow up to be a
                    healthy individual. One of the teachers had another student spank me because I did not know the
                    answer to a question. Another teacher had me kneel down for not getting enough marks in an exam,
                    and when a student pointed out that a river
                    ran down my face, she said "let him cry." These were only a few of many abusive incidents I faced
                    when I was
                    a child.
                    <br><br>
                    I've also been to Howard Model School in Hyderabad. Most of the
                    teachers I had were mostly abusive both orally and physically. A teacher bashed me vigorously with a
                    cane because I wrote "PTO" a couple of times on an empty page (as opposed to writing only once).
                    <br><br>
                    Part of my highschooling was done
                    in All Saints High School in Hyderabad. A teacher bashed me vigorously with a cane one day and I
                    still do not know why (I assume she did not like my handwriting since she initiated the act when I
                    showed her my notes) Another teacher said to my face "why can't you just be normal?" because I was
                    irregular to school (which was so because I felt unsafe in the school) She also said
                    to me in front of the whole class "Pregnant women get vomitings!" when I was late to class due to
                    sickness. Another teacher broke my plastic scale mid-exam because a student borrowed it instead of
                    bringing his own scale.
                    <br><br>
                    I completed high school in JMJ EM School in Anakapalle. I finally snapped here when a teacher was
                    being unreasonable and abusive. After being enlightened regarding my
                    sincerity by my parents, the teachers there have learned to be a little more reasonable with
                    me.
                    <br><br>
                    I can't say too much about higher secondary school since they already had an incident with
                    another student just before I joined the school. He stabbed a teacher and she died of blood loss.
                    They did try to be careful with me due to their past experience (St Marys AIHS School).
                    <br><br>
                    As for my
                    first Bachelor's Degree, I went to Madras Christian College. I learned some of the most important
                    lessons regarding social aspects of our culturally diverse society from the professors and the
                    students.
                    Some of the professors had unhealthy habits as part of their teaching methods- I thought they were
                    trying to
                    teach me to become a better version of myself (as is recommended by the
                    National Education Policy of India)
                    but they were imposing their own beliefs and
                    expecting me to act more
                    like them. Due to some of the western influences, there was not enough empathy
                    and sense of unity
                    in some of the professors, and they failed to act based on the truth that we are all on the
                    same side. They were also rude to me on more than one occassion without realising that I did
                    something as a result of their incompetencies.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope that the future teachers take their responsibilities more seriously than those from the past,
                    and
                    that a sense of unity will be promoted in order to create a more empathetic society;
                    that the unhealthy influences of the British colonials will soon be replaced by the productive
                    principles of the East.
