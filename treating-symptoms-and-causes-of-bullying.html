                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Once a student (13/M) was yelling at a few other students who were
                    sitting near him during a class. This particular student had a reputation for being "mischievous."
                    Instead of instructing him to be quiet, I asked him why he was yelling at them. He said that they
                    were calling him derogatory names. The other students did not deny this.
                    <br><br>
                    I told him that he should not react to people when they try to provoke him; that
                    if he reacts to everything others say, he would always be under someone else's control. I told him
                    to inform me if someone calls him names again. I told the other students not to do it and addressed
                    them again after the class.
                    <br><br>
                    Bullying is discussed among various theories such as personality theory, dominance theory,
                    organisational culture theory, humiliation theory, socio-cultural theory.
                    To understand which factors cause students to call someone names, you need to learn about the
                    students and their background. It is also important to understand the social dynamics of the class-
                    figuring out which student is initiating an action and who is following them.
                    <br><br>
                    There was one particular student who was the most influential of the group.
                    I spent some time talking with him and learning about his interests, hobbies, friends, family, life
                    goals, and a few other things.
                    
                    Being a trainee teacher, there was not much I could do to
                    guide his family. I offered a few suggestions regarding his interests and life goals in order to
                    guide him and to improve rapport. Since then, he began to show better results in academics
                    and social life.
