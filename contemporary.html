                    Schemas are mental structures that represent ideas or a person's knowledge which help them with
                    perception and interpretation of things.
                    While schemas help reduce the time it takes to interpret something, they can also limit one's
                    ability to understand something novel or influence their perception of it. Types of schemas include
                    self schema, object
                    schema, person schema, event schema.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Cognitive dissonance is a mental state in which there is a difference between one's experiences or
                    behaviour and one's
                    beliefs about what is true.
                    <br><br>
                    Cognitive dissonance creates a motivational drive in a person to reduce
                    the dissonance (similar to hunger). An individual is likely to reduce cognitive dissonance in one or
                    multiple ways- (1) accept new information and change
                    one's attitude or behaviour; (2) reject evidence and look for information to attempt to justify
                    inconsistency in one's behaviour; (3) trivialise the dissonant behaviour or the importance of the
                    attitude.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Self-fulfilling prophecy refers to a prediction that causes itself to become true
                    as a result of the expectation that it would come true. If a person thinks
                    something will happen, they may consciously or unconsciously make it happen through their actions or
                    inaction.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if a teacher believes that a student is unlikely to achieve great things
                    in life, the teacher may reduce their effort in guiding the student since it would save the
                    teacher's time and energy. This causes the prediction to come true as the student would be ignored
                    or misguided.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Communication barriers are factors that prevent an idea from being effectively shared between the
                    speaker and the listener.

                    Communication barriers can be categorised into linguistic barriers, psychological barriers, physical
                    barriers, socio-cultural barriers, technological barriers, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples for communication barriers include lack of open mindedness, lack
                    of good mental health, cultural differences, misinterpretation, distance between the speaker and the
                    listener, etc.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Linguistic Relativity is a principle that suggests that the languages a person knows can
                    influence their attention, perception, and decisions. People who speak multiple languages can
                    perceive the world in more ways than those who speak one language. The ability to switch between
                    mindsets can be resourceful for problem solving.
