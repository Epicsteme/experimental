              Most online dictionaries explain words based on common usage,
              which may seem neutral, but it can sometimes misrepresent complex
              ideas. Most dictionaries define “anarchy” as disorder, lack of
              control, or absence of organization. While these explanations
              reflect popular usage, they fail to capture a deeper reality.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Anarchism is a political theory that questions whether anyone has
              the right to rule over others. It values individual freedom from
              domination and promotes communities based on equality and
              non-coercive decision-making.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              By focusing on chaos, dictionaries risk giving readers the false
              impression that the only alternative to government is disorder.
              Just as defining democracy as “mob rule” would mislead, defining
              anarchism as chaos ignores its role as an idea that advocates for
              caring communities.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Recognizing this broader meaning allows people to appreciate
              anarchism as a constructive critique of power and a vision for
              collaborative, self-governing societies.
