                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Independence</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Indian subcontinent consisted of various political kingdoms before colonials merged them all into a single political nation and imposed their beliefs on it, according to the history taught in education institutions in India around the time of this article's publication.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The local resources were taken away and the local peoples were denied opportunities to grow as individuals. It was oppression inflicted by spiritually retarded people on politically retarded peoples of Indian subcontinent. Eventually, the peoples of Indian subcontinent worked together and attained political independence.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Our ancestors were finally free. Free from what? The British? No, free from the oppressive rule of British monarchy which was grounded on a life-negating system called christianity (whose values were not the same as the teachings of Christ)
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    We, the descendants of freedom fighters and oppressed generations, are also free. Free to do what? Free to oppress ourselves? No.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    We are free to educate ourselves; we are free to explore and learn what we didn't know; we are free to grow as individuals; we are free to overcome our weaknesses; we are free to fulfill our potential as human beings.
                </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Stephen Hawking</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Stephen Hawking could barely move his body for most of his life due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). He used a computer to help communicate with others, to learn new things, and he kept growing as an individual in whatever way he could while also providing theoretical knowledge about the universe for the rest of humanity. On top of it all, he kept his sense of humour as well.
                </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Diversity</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    India consists of significant diversity. There are rivers, seas, mountains, deserts, islands, and more. There are various kinds of creatures in all of these places. Societies with various cultures and worldviews are present. It all makes India what it is.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Some people of the country prioritse the idea of one single god, some people many gods, some people none at all. Some consume meat and some do not. Some consume dairy and some do not. Some prioritise monogamy and some do not.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    What makes a person Indian if they are all so diverse from each other?
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    What makes one an Indian is, among many things, the celebration of difference; the desire and fulfilment of learning a wide variety of things from those who see the world differently- in order to overcome the boundaries of knowledge and wisdom provided by the system that one was born into, and to overcome oneself.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Coastline Paradox</h3>
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The coastline paradox points out that the measured length of a coastline varies depending on the method used to measure and calculate it. The smaller the units, the lengthier the coast. This is due to the fact that landmass has features that scale from miles to fractions of a millimeter.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Depending on how you choose to see the world or which parts you focus on, everything will seem that way to you. It is important to acknowledge differences in things and in each individual. No two things (or persons) are entirely the same. Chaos theory must not be ignored. Generalisation is often a logical fallacy. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Age of Reason</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The Age of Reason was an intellectual and philosophical movement in Europe in 17 and 18th centuries. Ideas and perspectives of human happiness, pursuit of knowledge, liberty, progress, tolerance, etc. were explored. The rise of systems based on reasoning undermined the authority of relgious officials.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    When the people of scientific communities in the west started to claim that Earth was not at the center of the universe, they were attacked by the wilfully ignorant people, because their religious belief system was no longer going to be valid the same way.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Eventually paradigms shifted among societies away from wilful ignorance and towards tolerance and pursuit of knowledge, among other things.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    When I was young, children my age were taught that there were nine planets in the solar system. Later, they claimed that Pluto was no longer considered a planet (they called it a dwarf planet instead). Some millenials complained about the change for a while but they did it in a joking manner because they accepted the change.
                </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Open Society</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Karl Popper explores the idea of Paradox of Tolerance in which a society that tolerates everything will be destroyed by intolerance.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A suggested solution to this is for the society to tolerate everything except intolerance. However, those with intolerant views should not be silenced forcefully but instead be offered the right to speech among other rights, so that they may share about their views in a way considered acceptable by this system. This system recommends that violence may be used as a final resort against the intolerant if the intolerant do not participate in a dialog or find common ground.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    As Swami Vivekananda stated, it is essential for one to sustain not just tolerance towards difference but also the desire to learn different things. One may hold close the culture and views they were born into but should strive to grow by learning from those with differing views.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    One must remember that no single system is objectively superior or acceptable just because there are no altenatives to it at the time. Ultimately, knowledge and perspectives are infinite, and there is always something one does not yet know.
