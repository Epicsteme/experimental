                    Schemas are mental structures that represent a person's knowledge or ideas which help them with
                    perception and interpretation of things.
                    While schemas help reduce the time it takes to interpret something, they can also limit one's
                    ability to understand something novel or influence their perception of it. Types of schemas include
                    self schema, object
                    schema, person schema, event schema.

                    Metacognition is the awareness or analysis of one's own learning or thinking processes, often
                    involving
                    regulation of the processes. This helps one learn better and come up with effective solutions to
                    problems.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Cognitive dissonance is a mental state in which there is a difference between one's experiences or
                    behaviour and one's
                    beliefs about what is true.
                    <br><br>
                    Cognitive dissonance creates a motivational drive in a person to reduce
                    the dissonance (similar to hunger). An individual is likely to reduce cognitive dissonance in one or
                    multiple ways- (1) accept new information and change
                    one's attitude or behaviour; (2) reject evidence and look for information to attempt to justify
                    inconsistency in one's behaviour; (3) trivialise the dissonant behaviour or the importance of the
                    attitude.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Reductionism is the oversimplification of something complex. It also refers to the assumption that
                    there is only a single, simple cause
                    of an outcome when in fact, there may have been many causes.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Survivorship bias is the tendency to focus on entities that have passed through some selection
                    process and ignoring those that did not. This leads to the formation of incorrect judgements and
                    conclusions due to the bias in selection.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Self-fulfilling prophecy refers to a prediction that causes itself to become true
                    as a result of the expectation that it would come true. If a person thinks
                    something will happen, they may consciously or unconsciously make it happen through their actions or
                    inaction.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if a teacher believes that a student is unlikely to achieve great things
                    in life, the teacher may reduce their effort in guiding the student since it would save the
                    teacher's time and energy. This causes the prediction to come true as the student would be ignored
                    or misguided.

                    Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand and regulate one's own feelings, and understand
                    others' feelings and behave accordingly to avoid or solve problems. It is possible to improve one's
                    own emotional intelligence through reflection, meditation, etc.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Communication barriers are factors that prevent an idea from being effectively shared between the
                    speaker and the listener.

                    Communication barriers can be categorised into linguistic barriers, psychological barriers, physical
                    barriers, socio-cultural barriers, technological barriers, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples for communication barriers include lack of open mindedness, lack
                    of good mental health, cultural differences, misinterpretation, distance between the speaker and the
                    listener, etc.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Linguistic Relativity is a principle that suggests that the languages a person knows can
                    influence their attention, perception, and decisions. People who speak multiple languages can
                    perceive the world in more ways than those who speak one language. The ability to switch between
                    mindsets can be resourceful for problem solving.

                    Willful ignorance is the deliberate attempt at avoiding or rejecting information or
                    evidence that contradicts one's preconceived notions. Though this helps protect
                    one's own emotional state, it can be harmful in many ways.

                    Catharsis is an emotional release linked to relieving unconscious conflicts and intense
                    emotions built over time. The purification or purgation of emotions is done primarily through the
                    creation or viewing of art. Greek tragedies are a prime example. Other methods include
                    exercising, journaling, psychodrama, talking with a friend.
