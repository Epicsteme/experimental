                    If you cannot efficiently solve a problem with the knowledge and perspectives you possess,
                    acquire more knowledge and perspectives.

                <h3 class="display-6">The Incident</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Once a student (13/M) was yelling at those who were
                    sitting near him. This particular student had a reputation for being "mischievous." Instead of
                    instructing him to be quiet, I asked him why he was yelling at them. He said that they were calling
                    him derogatory names. The other students did not deny this.
                    <br><br>
                    I told him that he should not react to people when they try to provoke him; that
                    if he reacts to everything others say, he would always be under someone else's control. I told him
                    to inform me if someone calls him names again. I told the other students not to do it and addressed
                    them again after the class.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">The Causes</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Bullying is discussed among various theories such as personality theory, dominance theory,
                    organisational culture theory, humiliation theory, socio-cultural theory.
                    To understand which factors cause students to call someone names, you need to learn about the
                    students and their background. It is also important to understand the social dynamics of the class-
                    figuring out which student is initiating an action and who is following them.
                    <br><br>
                    There was one particular student who was the most influential of the group.
                    I spent some time talking with him and learning about his interests, hobbies, friends, family, life
                    goals, and a few other things. Being a trainee teacher, there was not much I could do to
                    guide his
                    family. I offered some suggestions regarding his interests and life goals in order to
                    guide him and to develop better rapport so that he could feel he could connect with me. Since then,
                    he began to
                    show better results in academics and social life.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I thoughtfully addressed an undesirable incident in classroom and took actions which resulted in the
                    students showing better progress in academics
                    and social life.
                    <br><br>
                    To effectively deal with undesirable behaviour, it is important for you to learn as much as
                    possible about psychology as well as how to talk to people. Read a lot of psychology books,
                    journals, web
                    blogs, watch seminars and public speeches, observe and talk to everyone, especially those with
                    lifestyles and habits different from yours. Most importantly, be kind, patient, respectful, and open
                    minded.
