                    If you cannot efficiently solve a problem with the knowledge and perspectives you possess,
                    acquire more knowledge and perspectives.

                <h3 class="display-6">The Incident</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    During a class, I noticed a student (13/M) yelling at the students who were sitting near him. This
                    particular student had a reputation for being "mischievous."
                    Instead of instructing him to be quiet, I asked him why he was yelling at them. He said that they
                    were
                    calling him derogatory names. The other students did not deny this.
                    <br><br>
                    I told him that he should not
                    react to people when they speak ill of him or try to provoke him. I told him that he should not give
                    power over himself to others; that if he reacts to everything others say, he would always be under
                    someone else's control. I told him to inform the teacher the next time someone calls him names, and
                    that he should respond
                    to such people only when his work is being affected.
                    <br><br>
                    I spoke with the other students and taught them to be kind to their classmates and help them when in
                    need instead
                    of making fun of them; that building a reciprocative relationship would benefit everyone.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Evaluation of the Incident</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Though I was momentarily bothered that the student was disturbing the class, I chose to remain calm
                    and find out what was happening and why. It turned out to be a good thing to enquire the students
                    regarding the matter which allowed me to
                    understand the whole picture and give appropriate guidance to the students.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Understanding the Causes</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In order to understand what caused the students to behave the way they did - a group of students
                    calling names - a student taking offence and reacting - you have to be familiar with various
                    psychological factors, among other things.
                    <br><br>
                    Bullying is often a result of inferiority complex, inadequate affection, inadequate attention,
                    dysfunctional families, peer influence, etc. To understand which factors cause students to call
                    someone names, you need to know the background of the students. You also need to figure out which
                    student is inspiring others to bully and why others choose to follow.
                    <br><br>
                    In the incident mentioned, there was one particular student who was the most influential
                    of the group.
                    I spent some time talking with him and learned about his interests, hobbies, friends, family, life
                    goals, and a few other things. This student came from a troubled family and he lacked healthy role
                    models outside of school. Being a trainee teacher, there was not much I could do to guide his
                    family. I made some comments and suggestions regarding his interests and life goals in order to
                    guide him, and to develop better rapport and a more common ground where he could feel that he could
                    connect with me. Since then, he began to show better progress in academics and social life.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I thoughtfully addressed an undesirable incident in classroom and took actions which resulted in the students showing better progress in academics
                    and social life.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important for you to learn as much as possible about psychology as well as how to talk to
                    people. Read a lot of psychology books, journals, web blogs, watch seminars, observe and talk to
                    everyone, especially those with lifestyles and habits different from yours. Most importantly, be kind, patient,
                    respectful, and open minded.
