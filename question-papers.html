                    One of my seniors made up a story and filled the pages in an English language test. Though it did not answer the question at hand, the essay was awarded marks anyway since it fulfilled the underlying criteria of the question.

                <h3 class="display-6">Introduction</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    One of the most common problems that teachers/invigilators face is preventing students from copying in an exam.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Right to flexibility</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Instead of giving choices in the question paper or giving the same question paper to all students, give the blueprint to the students and make them come up with their own question papers. It matters very little which questions they choose as long as they meet the criteria of the blueprint.

                    What does this achieve?

                    It gives students flexibility while
                    staying true to the purpose of testing student for academic achievement. It teaches students to understand the lessons better since they have to understand which question falls under which academic achievement and why.

                    What are the challenges of this model?
                    More time and energy for teacher to check the answer sheets.
