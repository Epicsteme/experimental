                <p>
                    With considerable amount of experience in teaching at school level and developing videogames, I have
                    been able
                    to draw
                    parallels between the two.

                    Gagné's Nine Events Of Instruction is a series of steps employable in teaching learning process.
                    This article aims to approach game design through an educator's perspective with special reference
                    to Gagné's nine events of instruction.

                <p>
                    You have around 20 seconds before a player decides whether they want to keep playing your game or
                    give up on it. You should try to provide an experience within the first 20 seconds that makes them
                    want to stay.
                    <br><br>
                    At the start of the game, you can show the player something spectacular, thought provoking,
                    questions that
                    create suspense or anticipation, or something along these lines. This could help you make the player
                    stay.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, some racing games would often let the player drive a relatively fast car in order to
                    give them
                    a taste of what they could be doing once they make enough progress. Some walking simulators put the
                    player in a strange scenario where they would be asking questions to gain clarification.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have shown the player what they will be working for, you tell them what is expected from
                    them. This often involves completing numerous missions or tasks. For example, racing
                    games tell the player that they need to start with the low level racers and work their way towards
                    the top of
                    the chart. Walking simulators tell the player that they need to solve puzzles, talk to someone,
                    complete some tasks in order to solve a mystery or accomplish the end goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Provide the player with tools and information (mechanics such as movement, jump, boost, shoot) which
                    are necessary to overcome a challenge. Since the player already knows what it is to walk, run, jump,
                    drive, etc. you can use their prior knowledge to build something new on top of it, such as double
                    jumps, wall jumps, wall running, driving on unusual surfaces.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="present-the-content">Present the content</h2>
                <p>
                    Provide the player with the level. In a platformer game, begin with a static platform with no risk
                    involved. Then add a platform that moves back and forth. Then add a static platform with no safe
                    ground underneath. Then add a moving platform with no safe ground underneath.
                    <br><br>
                    Here you are presenting the elements of the level in such a way that the player begins learning to
                    use the mechanics (run and jump) in a safe and easy environment and then in a slightly more risky
                    and challenging environment.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="provide-learning-guidance">Provide learning guidance</h2>
                <p>
                    You can use in-world elements to guide the player regarding what to do, how to do, where to go,
                    etc. Some games show the player that a certain part of the level is lethal by having an NPC (non
                    playable character) walk into the lethal zone. Some games show the player that there is a hidden
                    path or entrance by adding moss at the entrance or having sunrays fall on it. Some games show that
                    the player can use certain parts of the environment by having an NPC or any other game object
                    interact with the parts of the environment. For example, if a platform is likely to collapse within
                    a second of touching it, a rock or an NPC can be shown falling on it and then the platform being
                    destroyed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the player is shown the basics and the core mechanics, it is time to test the player. Create an
                    elaborate level filled with platforms and challenges in various combinations to provide an
                    opportunity for the player to demonstrate that they have understood the
                    rules/mechanics of the game and are capable of applying their knowledge in a variety of scenarios.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="provide-feedback">Provide feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Feedback is crucial in guiding the player. Positive feedback such as rewards encourages the player
                    to
                    repeat an
                    action or proceed in a certain direction, and negative feedback such as losing a life, an item, or
                    points prompts the player to avoid
                    repeating something.
                    <br><br>
                    Feedback in visual, auditory, and haptic can add depth, responsiveness, and immersiveness to
                    player's experience. For example, when a character is running, have some dust particles rise up at
                    their feet. If a car hits a pole, play appropriate audio to reflect the action happening on the
                    screen. Some videogame controllers provide haptic feedback for nearly everything happening on the
                    screen. Learn more from Grapefrukt's <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">video</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Feedback should be provided to the player for every action they perform. If the player does
                    something, the game should tell them what changes have occured in the game. If the player is
                    expected to do something, the game should be explicit about it and also hint at it. If
                    the player fails at completing a
                    task, it should not be so because the game did not provide adequate information or in a clear
                    manner. An interesting <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=6vJNqseX-rs">example</a> for this is Mark
                    Of The Ninja
                    <br><br>
                    If the player character dies, the game should make it explicit how the character died
                    and how the same can be avoided. If the player shoots an NPC, clear feedback should be provided to
                    convey that the hit was registered, and how much health the NPC had lost.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="assess-performance">Assess performance</h2>
                <p>
                    Raise the stakes and increase the level of difficulty. Provide opportunities such as a range of
                    bosses,
                    challenging level design, or other
                    high level challenges for the player to overcome with the help of all the knowledge they have gained
                    so
                    far
                    and the skills they
                    have mastered. An interesting <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=VQ_KrRq4UiA">example</a> for this
                    is Ginso Tree from Ori And The Blind Forest.
                    <br><br>
                    You can have a series of moving platforms which also break when the
                    player touches them; remove the ground under the platforms; have a time limit; an NPC continuously
                    attacking the player character.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="enhance-retention-and-transfer">Enhance retention and transfer</h2>
                <p>
                    Design levels in such a way that the knowledge and skills acquired in an earlier level can be
                    utilised in the present level while also introducing a new mechanic which will be present or used in
                    the upcoming level.
                    This not only adds variety to the game but also allows the player to practice, carry their knowledge
                    over to a novel setting while learning something new in addition to their existing knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Some platformer games implement various kinds of platforms which appear in multiple levels and in
                    various contexts where new platforms are also introduced. Super Mario 3D World is an interesting <a
                        href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA"> example</a>.
