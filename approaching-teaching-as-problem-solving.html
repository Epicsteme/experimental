                    If you cannot efficiently solve a problem with the knowledge and perspectives you currently possess,
                    acquire
                    more knowledge and perspectives.
                </p>

                <h3 class="display-6">Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine sudoku. You know that at the end, each number should exist only once in each row, column,
                    and section. To fill the cells, you take into consideration the numbers which are already present.
                    You analyse and decide where to place a number.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine teaching. You know that a student should acquire certain skills or knowledge by the
                    end of a class or course. To educate them, you take into consideration their abilities and a few
                    other things. You analyse all the factors and decide how to teach.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <h3 class="display-6">Possess Knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                    To solve a sudoku puzzle, you must be able to read and recall numbers, know how to think about
                    the information that is available and missing.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to teach efficiently, you must be acquainted with a lot of knowledge regarding many
                    fields including psychology, philosophy, and sociology.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Adapt to Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine the numbers in the grids are constantly changing in languages. You then learn more languages
                    to
                    be able to read and enter numbers.
                    <br><br>
                    Various challenges are faced by educators. You must learn to analyse these challenges and apply
                    reasoning skills to overcome them in the most productive way possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Knowledge regarding problem solving can be acquired by constantly learning from everyone and
                    everything including seminars and peer reviewed journals. Learn from multiple sources of knowledge
                    including your juniors. Your own attitude should not be a barrier to acquiring knowledge. The end
                    goal is to solve problems. Prioritise that and act on it.
                    <br><br>
                    The mind is a tool which is not to be taken for granted. Books and other things help speed up
                    learning process, but if you can think systematically and contemplate the nature of things, you
                    may be able to solve a novel problem with relative ease.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Steps of Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Identify & analyse the scenario.
                    <br>
                    How is the given scenario different from the expected standard?
                    <br>
                    How much damage is being caused due to the variation from the standard?
                    <br>
                    How quickly should this variation be addressed?
                    <br><br>

                    2. Describe the scenario.
                    <br>
                    Clearly and concisely describe the scenario to gain clarity towards the end goal.
                    <br><br>

                    3. Identify the factors of the scenario.
                    <br>
                    What caused this variation from the expected standard?
                    <br>
                    Can it be addressed in such a way that it will not happen again?
                    <br><br>

                    4. Develop potential ideas to address the scenario with.
                    <br>
                    What can be done to adjust the variation?
                    <br>
                    What better alternatives are there to the idea I just came up with?
                    <br><br>

                    5. Implement and Evaluate.
                    <br>
                    Execute the ideas and evaluate the effects.
                </p>
