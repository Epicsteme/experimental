                    Completing an easy task offers encouragement to take up a harder task.

                    To improve reading skill, I told my students to read a specific text and ask to clarify their
                    doubts. A student seemed uninterested in the activity as he found it challenging to read the text.
                    Instead of forcing him, I rephrased the instruction and told him to ask me five doubts. He promptly
                    started reading and asking doubts as expected.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Instead of forcing the student to follow an instruction,
                    I reconsidered my approach and offered a variation of the instruction with a clear and relatively
                    easy target that he could see himself accomplishing in a short span of time. The next day, I
                    increased the number of questions I expected him to ask and he accomplished his goal that day.
