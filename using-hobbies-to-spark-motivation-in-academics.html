                <p class="lh-lg">
                    When I started out as a trainee teacher, I made a note of the students who were least
                    motivated to learn my subject (English) and those who would often disturb their neighbours.
                    <br><br>
                    I called these students aside during break time and talked to them in order to get to know them
                    and develop rapport.
                    <br><br>
                    Some students were interested in videogames. If they played a shooting game, I asked them who
                    they played with, which guns they liked, whether they preferred close range combat or long range
                    combat, camping or rushing, headshots or spraying, etc.
                    Asking such questions helped not only to get to know them better but also to show them that I
                    could relate with their interests.
                    <br><br>
                    A student said that he played with his friends and that he liked desert eagle. I asked him why he
                    liked a weapon with low fire rate. Here I made a comment on a very specific detail that would only
                    be known to people familiar with the game. He was not only surprised but also excited that I knew
                    about the game he liked and played.
                    <br><br>
                    I told him how learning english could help him make more friends through multiplayer games- that he
                    could make friends from other states and even other countries.

                    I reminded him about how he had to practice daily in order to get good at the game, and told him
                    that it takes daily practice to get good at a language as well. I suggested him to watch videogame reviews and streams of the games he liked with subtitles enabled. This would allow him to acquire listening skills as well as reading skills. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some students were interested in sketching or some other visual arts. I asked them to show me their
                    artworks and I asked them about their preferences. Most of them had some preferences such as
                    mehandi, nature, cartoon characters, etc. and they often used pens, pencils, colour pencils,
                    sketches, etc. in their notebooks, dedicated art books, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    I would appreciate their works, and offer suggestions regarding what they could draw and how they
                    could improve their skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I would draw comparision between visual arts and language in order to create interest in learning
                    the language. I told them about how they were creating something beautiful by putting a few lines
                    and shapes together, and told them that they could create something beautiful through words as well
                    by putting them together in various combinations.
                    <br><br>
                    Whenever students showed me their artworks, I asked them questions and taught them a few things
                    related to their art. For example, when a student drew a peacock, I asked them whether
                    peacocks could fly, what peacocks ate, etc. If they drew greenery, I would point to a bush or
                    something and ask what that thing was called or how it was spelt. This way, the students get to gain
                    knowledge through their own works and interests. Some students would trace images from books or
                    other sources. I would tell them about rotoscopy and how similar techniques are used to make
                    cartoons. This could help them become aware of career options.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few days, these students showed a significant difference in their attitude towards the language. They often asked me doubts, asked me for more suggestions, asked me to give them activities, etc. A student who struggled to frame sentences in english was able to give a self introduction with no errors in structure or pronunciation. He was able to learn this through videos and audio clips on the internet. Other students also showed considerable improvement in their skills over time.
