                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Philosophers who create complex systems distort truths to fit them into their frameworks,
                    prioritising coherence over truth. This focus on maintaining the integrity of their system rather
                    than pursuing genuine understanding reflects a deeper psychological need for certainty, not
                    intellectual honesty.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    These systems aim to explain reality in a structured way, offering neat answers on existence,
                    morality, and knowledge. However, in doing so, they suppress inconvenient facts to maintain
                    consistency, leading to intellectual dishonesty. Instead of embracing the complexities of life,
                    systematizers ignore contradictions that challenge their frameworks, ultimately sacrificing
                    philosophical integrity.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Religions illustrate this tendency by presenting rigid, all-encompassing doctrines. In their quest
                    for absolute certainty, they reject new evidence or reinterpret inconvenient facts to preserve their
                    dogmas, as seen in the denial of scientific theories like evolution. This rigid adherence to a
                    closed system prevents growth and adaptation, leading to intellectual stagnation.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Nietzsche advocates for a more flexible approach, urging philosophers to embrace the chaos and
                    uncertainty of life rather than impose rigid systems. True integrity means abandoning one's
                    framework when it no longer aligns with reality instead of distorting facts to preserve it. This
                    openness to change requires intellectual courage, as it involves confronting the unknown rather than
                    clinging to the comfort of certainty.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Ultimately, Nietzsche's critique challenges the value of systems in philosophy, religion, and even
                    science. While they can provide clarity, they become prisons that limit our thinking and close us
                    off from new ideas. True intellectual freedom involves staying open to new perspectives, embracing
                    ambiguity, and having the courage to question even our most deeply held beliefs.
