                    Imagine sudoku. You know that at the end, each number should exist only once in each row, column,
                    and section. To fill the cells, you take into consideration the numbers which are already present.
                    You analyse and decide where to place a number.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine teaching. You know that a student should acquire certain skills or knowledge by the
                    end of a class or course. To educate them, you take into consideration their abilities and a few
                    other things. You analyse all the factors and decide how to teach.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Possess Knowledge</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    To solve a sudoku puzzle, you must be able to read and recall numbers, know how to think about
                    the information that is available and missing.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to teach efficiently, you must be acquainted with a lot of knowledge from many
                    fields including psychology, philosophy, and sociology.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="display-6">Adapt to Changes</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Imagine the puzzles are appearing in different languages. You learn more languages
                    to be able to read and enter numbers.
                    <br><br>
                    Various challenges are faced by educators. You must learn to analyse these challenges and use
                    reasoning skill to overcome them in the most peaceful and productive way possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Knowledge regarding problem solving can be acquired by continuously learning from everyone and
                    everything including books, journals, seminars. Learn from multiple sources of knowledge
                    including your juniors - you may know more than your juniors, but they may know at least a few
                    things which you do not, and those few things could help you a lot. Your own attitude should
                    not be a barrier to learning. The end goal is to solve problems. Prioritise that and act
                    on it.
                    <br><br>
                    The mind is a tool which is not to be taken for granted. Books and other things help speed up
                    learning process, but if you can think systematically and contemplate the nature of things, you
                    may be able to solve a novel problem with relative ease.

                    Recommended Action
                </h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    1. Whenever something goes wrong, instead of looking for excuses or for someone to blame, ask
                    yourself
                    what you can do to make things better in a peaceful and productive manner.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Talk to everyone, learn from everyone and everything, especially from those with
                    lifestyles different from yours. It is when you expand your interaction beyond your close
                    circles that you learn to think
                    and see things in various ways and solve problems more efficiently.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Visit places with
                    completely different cultures or
                    languages. Stay kind, patient, and open minded with others and yourself. <a

                    Proof of Concept
                </h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    When I was an intern, two of my students got into a conflict with each other. I reminded them of
                    their interests and ambitions (which I asked them about earlier in order to get to know them);
                    about the mindset and behaviour they ought to possess in order to achieve their goals (Having an aim
                    in life helps maintain composure and discipline) I informed them that I was not scolding them or
                    punishing them (in order to preserve rapport and their emotional well being) but that I was only
                    telling them something important to remember throughout their lives. I pointed out that their
                    actions did not solve any problems, and taught them that it is okay to experience feelings; that it
                    is important to stay calm and think things through before doing something; that they should talk to
                    each other peacefully and ask themselves what they need to do to solve the problem at hand.
                    I taught them what they needed to do the next time a similar conflict occurred. Later, a similar
                    conflict occurred and they handled it in a calm and mature manner without letting emotions take
                    over.
                    MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!
                    <br><br>
                    To inspire students, consistency in behaviour is important. If you tell your students that they
                    should stay calm but you act with force, think ill of them, or speak ill of them behind their backs,
                    they may not develop desirable attitude or behaviour. Students notice everything, and the
                    inconsistencies in your reactions, attitude, or behaviour are often not so subtle to their eyes.
