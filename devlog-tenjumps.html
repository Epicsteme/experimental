                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    This game was made for The Fresh Game Jam 2021. I chose to make a platformer as I was looking to improve my skill in designing levels for
                    platformers.

                    I was inspired by a fancy little indie platformer called
                    Un-Evergreen by Motor in which you have a limited
                    number of jumps.

                    I applied the concept of limited jumps to fit the theme "management" (you have to manage your jumps)
                    and worked on improving my level designing skill.

                    Designing the level for this game was tricky since the player has a limited number of jumps to use.
                    Among other things, this restriction forced me to come up with the pink platforms that gave a free
                    instant jump for the player character, adding variety to the gameplay as well as the level.

                    I created multiple scripts, each with a specific mechanic or behaviour, allowing me to quickly apply
                    any script to any platform that I thought needed that mechanic or combination of mechanics.

                    The banners on the wall are hints that convey to the player where they needed to use a jump. I set
                    the hints to be invisible by default and added the ability to make them visible on a key press so
                    that the players can choose whether they want the hints, adding a bit of control over the difficulty
                    of the game.

                    In order to improve my skill in creating sprites, I made my own art for most parts of the game
                    using LibreSprite.

                    The brick sprite is reused for the platforms as well as the background, with slight change to the
                    colour to differentiate one from the other.
