              Part 1: Linguistic dominance
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Language is more than a tool for communication—it shapes social
              structures and cultural identities. When a new language is
              forcibly introduced in a region which has its own local language,
              the new (foreign) language can become dominant, leading to social
              and cultural inequality. The foreign language gains linguistic
              capital<sup>[1]</sup>
              and market value<sup>[2]</sup>, offering economic and social
              advantages, such as jobs, services, and connections, while the
              local language becomes less important, less prestigious, or less
              worthy.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              This dominance is upheld through symbolic power<sup>[3]</sup> and
              cultural hegemony<sup>[4]</sup>, which make people internalize the
              superiority of the foreign language, even if they speak their
              local language at home. This can lead to speakers of the local
              language feeling inferior.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The foreign language spreads at the expense of the local language,
              often supported by institutions. It functions like racism or
              sexism—privileging one group while marginalizing the other. This
              process shapes education, media, and public life, and leads to
              inequality.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Over time, the foreign language spreads like a successful
              "meme"—not by erasing others, but by being more appealing and
              rewarded. As more people adopt it, especially children, the local
              language weakens and may eventually disappear.

            <p class="fw-bold">Case Study</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The French government made efforts to promote the use of French,
              hoping to unify the country through a common language.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The regional languages began to decline in 1539, when the French
              government made the Paris dialect, Francien (Standard French), the
              only official language.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The spread of Standard French was eventually driven by increased
              literacy and access to written language. In the 1880s, new school
              laws banned other languages and punished children for speaking
              them. The French administration made Occitan (regional language)
              speakers believe that their language was just a corrupted form of
              French, used only by uneducated and ignorant people.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In 2021, a new bill (called Molac's Law) tried to allow schools to
              teach most subjects in regional languages instead of French, but
              the French supreme court rejected that part, saying it went
              against the French constitution, which says French must be the
              language of the Republic.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In the present day, Occitan is spoken only by the oldest
              inhabitants of the region (only within the neighborhood and family
              circle), and is likely to die out when they are gone.

              Part 2: Why English matters
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In a study by the European Institute of Business Administration,
              Kai Chan created the Power Language Index (PLI), which ranked
              languages based on five types of opportunities they offer: (1)
              Geography: The ability to travel, (2) Economy: The ability to
              participate in an economy, (3) Communication: The ability to
              engage in dialogue, (4) Knowledge and media: The ability to
              consume knowledge and media, (5) Diplomacy: The ability to engage
              in international relations.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              After comparing the efficacy of more than one hundred languages in
              these five domains, it was found that English is the most powerful
              language overall, and it ranks highest in all five areas. It holds
              the top position as the world's lingua franca.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Mandarin is gaining influence but still ranks a distant second.
              French takes third place, with strong results in geography and
              diplomacy. Next are Spanish, Arabic, and Russian, completing the
              top six—all of which, even without considering diplomacy, are
              official languages of the United Nations. German and Japanese,
              spoken in major economic powers, rank seventh and eighth. The top
              ten is completed by Portuguese and Hindi, both of which are also
              BRIC languages.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Language is a key factor in global competitiveness. It is not a
              coincidence that eight of the world's top ten financial centres
              are cities where English is widely spoken or well understood.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="lh-lg">
              <span class="fw-bold">Implications:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              For individuals, language can help them succeed, and the index
              shows which languages are most useful. For business leaders, the
              index shows which languages are most important for reaching people
              worldwide. For policymakers, the index supports the idea that
              English gives people a big advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              India should prioritize improving English proficiency among the
              population rather than imposing Hindi across all regions of the
              country. The fact that English was once the language of the
              colonizers is less relevant today. What is more significant is
              that English is now one of the most widely spoken languages
              globally, serves as a lingua franca, and offers greater practical
              advantages compared to many other languages.
