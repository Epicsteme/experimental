                    A saffron sky dawned on us. All our scars on the table. The clock racing against the hearts
                    in our hands. Tethered by naught but a string of heart. Flushed in a wave of fleeting stars.
                    An unsung web of worlds untethered.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Eighty pieces of puzzle riddled down the river. Salty stream pulled on my strings. No
                    two pieces fashioned together. Icy current stripped me of my soul. Was I the last piece, or
                    was it all a lie?

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    An ocean of voices condensed all around me. They are but mirages in which I drowned. The
                    air
                    turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye I lay
                    paralysed,
                    gasping for breath.

                <h3 class="display-6">Grey Paradise</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A gloomy river of clouds flooded the blue sky. Piercing wind carried the scent of death
                    as
                    eagles soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled unceremoniously; they
                    circled
                    back
                    to the start and gathered as they were. Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after
                    wave,
                    they
                    missed their prey. Upon being left alone by their predators, the pigeons sought company
                    among
                    their own. The mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers from the
                    west.

                <h3 class="display-6">Birds of the Sky</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked wall. Their feathers
                    were of
                    colour akin to that of wood in the rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a
                    constellation
                    of
                    tiny specks glowed from within.
                    <br><br>
                    A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with his back to the wall
                    and
                    let
                    out a breath of prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him,
                    the
                    creatures began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its
                    eyelids, a
                    thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The creature flew up to the bowl and
                    indulged
                    itself. The rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                    <br><br>
                    Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of the child, turning them
                    to
                    cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The source,
                    he
                    realised, was outside.
                    <br><br>
                    Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards the door to the
                    balcony.
                    With
                    every step, hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat
                    louder.
                    <br><br>
                    An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide open. An obscure being
                    with
                    a
                    translucent form sat among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in
                    ways
                    unnatural.
                    <br><br>
                    Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense little shades moved in
                    front
                    of
                    the clouds. The winged creatures were as fast as their screeches. They moved with the
                    grace
                    of a
                    dancer and the swiftness of a fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm
                    of
                    lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The glass, tinted unevenly, did not open. On the other side are a great many windows
                    placed
                    symmetrically on walls of unsaturated colours. I could not count them all if I had an
                    eternity.
                    <br> <br>
                    At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall waving their hands at the
                    speeding train. I imagine they must have not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass.
                    Would
                    it
                    have been of any consequence to return the wave?
                    <br> <br>
                    The Gods painted the heavens with a symphony of colours. Never have I laid the slightest
                    glance upon a spectacle so terrifyingly breathtaking.
                    <br> <br>
                    Something peeked out of the sky. Its skewed body, scattered edges, and obscure being
                    mocked
                    me.
                    <br> <br>
                    "Does that look like a rabbit to you?"
                    <br> <br>
                    A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I wasn't expecting company.
                    To
                    my side is a child whose attention could not be taken off the clouds.
                    <br> <br>
                    The hind legs make it look more like a hare than a rabbit.
                    <br> <br>
                    "Sure," I replied.
                    <br> <br>
                    I gazed beyond to find a thin, subtle yet paralysing stroke of violet bordering a thick
                    fiery cloud. With all its might, the sky, on fire, roared bright.
                    <br> <br>
                    What does that one look like to you?
