                    An ocean of voices condensed all around me. They are but mirages in which I drowned. The air turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos  spiralled. In its eye I lay paralysed, gasping for breath.

                    A gloomy river of clouds flooded the blue sky. Piercing wind carried the scent of death as eagles soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled  unceremoniously; they circled back to the start and gathered as they were.  Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after wave, they missed their prey. Upon  being left alone by their predators, the pigeons sought company among
                    their own. The mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers  from the west.

                    Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked wall. Their feathers were of colour akin to that of wood in the rain. Their eyes were  dense as the void; a constellation of tiny specks glowed from within.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with his back to the wall and let out a breath of prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him, the creatures began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its eyelids, a thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The creature flew up to the bowl and indulged itself. The rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of the child, turning them to cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The source, he realised, was outside.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards the door to the balcony. With every step, hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat louder.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide open. An obscure being with a translucent form sat among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in ways unnatural.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense little shades moved in front of the clouds. The winged creatures were as fast as their  screeches. They moved with the grace of a dancer and the swiftness of a  fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm of lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                    The glass, tinted unevenly, did not open. On the other side are a great many windows placed symmetrically on walls of unsaturated colours. I could not count them all if I had an eternity.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall waving their hands at the speeding train. I imagine they must have not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass. Would it have been of any consequence to return the wave?

                    A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I wasn't expecting company. To my side is a child whose attention could not be taken off the clouds.

                    Some believed that the dawn of solar mines would bring peace among the colonies. They were wrong. Everything changed when the partisans attacked our embassy on Earth.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Rumours say that the partisans are working on something big- that an attack on the solar mines is inevitable. Whatever they're building will likely cause unimaginable horror. There's only so much I can do in the grand scheme of things, but getting at least a few people to safety is still something. A dozen people are currently on board, and most of them are scientists.

                    An alarm beeped. I flip a few switches and pull the mic closer. If I had known that this would be the last time that I would be flying, I'd have taken a few more passengers.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "Attention, passengers! This is your pilot speaking- the good looking one. We will be arriving at Chandrasekhar Space Station in a few moments. Put on your space suits and head to the hatch. We will have a very short period to stay docked- please be quick."

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The alarm beeped again. A partisans' patrol ship came closer with each passing second. I flip a few more switches. One of our rescue ships should be on the way.

                    I push a few buttons - hatch door lights blink for a moment. Unheard screams echo through the back of my mind, followed by a moment of peace. I turn the ship around to face the approaching patrol ship. Full thrusters.

                    The siren becomes louder with each passing second. I flip a few switches. A soft voice escaped speakers over my head.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "Initiating protocol Nemo."

                    A new destination is set. It's a good place to hide from partisans, and there's a lot of sun at the top of Ravihill - the truck should survive long enough.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The pounding of my heart drowned out the blaring of siren. I gently pull over before suspicion gets to whatever good is left in these men. Red and blue lights flash on the back of the truck.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Two men in dark clothing exit car and march towards the truck. The lights bounced off the badges on their shoulders. Their faces were shaved clean and their hair was most likely cut by someone who would disrespect their own friends.

                    I reach into the glove compartment. A strange name, I always thought. How often do you see someone store gloves in there? A great many things in this world are named one thing but do something else. My teacher always emphasised on the importance of appreciating both the differences and the interconnectedness of things. She hated the language she taught; often found it limiting. In her own way, she also respected it for what it is.

                    A lever hid at the roof of the compartment. A firm pull to send a message to my guardian in the sky. A missile fell through the clouds like a shooting star, blowing up the police car. The drone should be on their radar now, but it is a necessary sacrifice.

                    The voice from the speakers exclaimed "Autopilot activated." Engine revs and tires screech - gunshots follow - glass shatters - blood on the seat.

                    I may not make it, but the truck will. This is for the greater good.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In a small town called Ritchie, somewhere in the Uhpysis Valley, there is an unusual lamp. It is distorted in ways that are not of this world. It sat on a bridge and spoke in riddles.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I stand before the lamp and listen.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "Boundless lands I have walked. Under the blackest of skies camels march with mountains of lies on their backs. Dungeons of the deepest I have crept. Dead civilisations roar through time like the echoes of the past. Heaven and hell drift away like dreams of old. Awoke I a child from the Slumber - what am I?"
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    That was no riddle - that was a greeting in the language of the Few.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I return the greeting- "I am free."
