                        A young lass sat in a garden of stars.
                        A constellation of fireflies flocked around her. A spell of
                        breeze stole her veil away. Her face to the parted sun. Freckles on the cheek. A bite on
                        the
                        neck. A
                        subtle glance at the heavens.

                        Tattered clouds resembled the beach at dawn. Bare foot, a stroll down the coast. A
                        crescent
                        shining
                        shell peered through grains of cloud. How I wish I could carry it in a jar of glass.

                        Fiery clouds scattered down the horizon. The sky- red as a dragon's breath. From a
                        slumber
                        awakened
                        the beast - cosmic in nature, astronomical in scale. Lids humbly parted over the eye
                        that
                        robbed
                        the
                        sky of its light and bled through a cloak of clouds.

                        She pulls on my gaze yet she lingers away. The wind whispers in her voice. The ocean
                        stumbles
                        under
                        her breath. Her gaze- paralysing; her touch- subtle yet professing; her kiss- deadly.

                        to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye I lay paralysed, gasping

                        eagles
                        soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled unceremoniously; they circled back to
                        the
                        start and gathered as they were. Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after wave, they
                        missed
                        their
                        prey. Upon being left alone by their predators, the pigeons sought company among their own.
                        The
                        mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers from the west.

                        On the midnight of 13 April 2919, our broadcast had been answered by a particularly
                        intelligent
                        alien species. They sent us their own "Arecibo message."
                        <br><br>
                        It took us nearly a decade to decipher their message. When we did, the experts
                        concluded that the alien civilisation was a Type II on the Kardashev scale, and recommended
                        terminating the communication.
                        <br><br>
                        If history had taught us anything, it is that the encounters between civilisations with
                        advanced
                        versus primitive technologies have gone badly for the less advanced.

                        upon
                        a spectacle so terrifyingly breathtaking.
                        <br> <br>
                        Something peeked out of the sky. Its skewed body, scattered edges, and obscure being mocked
                        me.
                        <br> <br>
                        "Does that look like a rabbit to you?"
                        <br> <br>
                        A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I wasn't expecting company. To
                        my
                        side
                        is a child whose attention could not be taken off the clouds.
                        <br> <br>
                        The hind legs make it look more like a hare than a rabbit.
                        <br> <br>
                        "Sure," I replied.
                        <br> <br>
                        I gazed beyond to find a thin, subtle yet paralysing stroke of violet bordering a thick
                        fiery
                        cloud.
                        With all its might, the sky, on fire, roared bright.
                        <br> <br>
                        What does that one look like to you?

                    <p class="gamedevlog">
                        It is said that in Ooreville, which lies on the hill Kathihill, a cursed sword stands on the
                        cliff
                        that no man dares touch for it may strip them of the light in their minds.
                        <br><br>
                        This I can believe for I had an uncle, when I was a child, who visited the town to study the
                        phenomenon. Later that night, he was seen walking off the cliff.
                        <br><br>
                        Though some believe the sword fell from a world beyond our own, the scriptures allege it
                        belonged to
                        a man whose face the world shall forever be a stranger to.
                        <br><br>
                        The heavens whispered, in his dreams, of a fair maiden bound in a tower on the cliff. The stars
                        tethered his heart to her. He swore to find her and free her. His destiny awaited.
                        <br><br>
                        Stars drifted across the nights as he travelled across many lands, some of which were known only
                        to
                        a few. He carried with him a sword and a bag filled with the eyes of those that dared cross his
                        path.
                        <br><br>
                        On the walls of the tower sat a shadowy figure whose nature was not of the known world. It
                        seemed to
                        be a sort of monster, or a shadow of a monster, of a form only an ill mind could dream up. Its
                        form
                        resembled parts of moth and deer. An antlered head surmounted a stretched body with ripe wings.
                        Its
                        ragged figure, darker than night, hazier than dreams, twitched and flickered like flames.
                        <br><br>
                        The blade passed right through the misty void that it was. There was no bloor nor hurt.
                        <br><br>
                        With a penetrating gaze, the man marched towards the door and right through the void. Each
                        breath
                        cost him dearly his strength, and will had faded from his body. His chest, on fire, grew heavy.
                        A
                        crushing ache crowned on his head.
                        Consciousness waned. Had he not turned around as soon as he did, the void would have consumed
                        him.
                        <br><br>
                        A few moments passed before he caught his breath and gathered enough strength. Upon brief
                        contemplation, he dashed right back in with a speed that was nearly not meant to be.
                        <br><br>
                        No matter how great his speed was, nor how long he ran for, he came no closer to the door. Soon
                        he
                        was back out trembling like a featherless bird.
                        <br><br>
                        How would you kill what you could not touch?
                        <br><br>
                        He sat under a tree and contemplated the horizon as it swallowed countless suns. Memories of
                        those
                        that had set him on that path gathered for a summit.
                        <br><br>
                        An ocean of voices condensed all around him. They are but mirages in which he drowned. The air
                        turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye, he lay paralysed,
                        gasping for breath
                        <br><br>
                        In the distant corner of the summit was a bar in which a man sat with a bottle, grieving his
                        lately
                        missing eye. A chuckle silenced the memories. In the newfound quiet, the heavens whispered once
                        again.
                        <br><br>
                        The sword rested by a stone and footsteps approached the door to the tower. The floating abyss
                        swirled and flickered but did not suffocate.
                        <br><br>
                        Silence greeted him upon entering the tower. He paced up the stairs to the chamber at the top.
                        Cold
                        air turned stale and his breath numb. A strange yet familiar face greeted him. He fell on his
                        knees,
                        and a river ran down his face. He had finally found whom he had come to rescue. In the middle of
                        the
                        naked room, there stood a dust covered mirror.
