            <p class="lh-lg">
              I have participated in over 18 game jams so far and here is some
              of what I learned.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" id="why-game-jam">Why Game Jam?</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Game jams are opportunities for you to prototype ideas and check
              whether they are as good as you thought they would be before
              making a large game with similar mechanics. You also get to meet
              new people and learn from them. Networking is also great if you
              plan on building a career in related industries.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" id="scope">Scope</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Spend most of your time polishing the core mechanics, gameplay
              loop, and the level. More mechanics does not necessarily mean it
              is a better game, but a game with well-polished mechanics and
              gameplay means it is more likely to be a good and effective game.
              It is better to full-ass a few things than half-ass many things.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" id="resources">Resources</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Gather references for visuals and audio so the artist and music
              composer would know what kind of aesthetic and mood to aim for.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Create a shared spreadsheet with a list of all the required assets
              and progress. Allow your team to update the spreadsheet. This
              helps the team to see quickly and clearly what is required and how
              much is completed.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" id="team">Team</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              If you are new to game jams, team up with one or two members,
              optimally an artist and a music composer. Having someone working
              along with you makes it easier for you to focus on your own
              speciality.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Working as a team can also lead to a better game since each
              element has a specialist working on it. However, having too many
              teammates can be challenging to coordinate with and to maintain
              consistency in "game feel" if you are a beginner.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Be clear about what you want from the jam and what your teammates
              want too - is it a hobby or are you gaining experience to
              eventually become a professional? Make sure your commitment level
              aligns enough with that of your teammates for the project.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Trust your teammates' judgements- especially if they are not new
              to their fields. You may give them prompts and references to work
              with, but let them come up with their own ideas. Higher level of
              creative freedom can lead to creation of better assets.
              Micromanaging your teammates' works can lead to inconsistent "game
              feel" since a significant amount of your influence would clash
              with that of your teammates.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" id="reflect">Reflect</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Share the progress of your game with others from early on during
              development and consider their feedback.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              At the end of the jam, take feedback from other developers and
              from players, and reflect on it. Write down the feedback somewhere
              easily accessible- maybe in the project folder. This helps keep
              track of your growth and experience.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Analyse others' games and learn from those games while also
              providing feedback to the devs.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              1. What did you like about their game?
              <br />
              2. What was difficult to do or understand?
              <br />
              3. What could be changed for a more enjoyable experience?
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Take feedback from your teammates - ask them what you could have
              done differently to make their work easier. This helps you better
              plan or communicate with teammates in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Write a postmortem- mention what you aimed for, what worked out,
              what did not work out and what could have been done differently to
              make it work. This helps you reflect and learn from your
              experience.
            </p>
