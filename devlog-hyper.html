                    It was the first time that I completed a project. By the time this project began, I was already
                    familiar with some of the basics of game design and development. So, I decided to make something
                    similar to an existing game and tweak the design a little bit to allow me to improve my game
                    designing skills while also learning to develop a game. I chose Space Invaders as it seemed
                    relatively easier for me to execute and complete the project at the time.

                    On one hand, not all the scripts are as good as they could have been in maintaining a lighter CPU
                    workload. On the other hand, I took a few shortcuts with some parts of the development, without
                    affecting the gameplay, to save time, and reduce the work load on the computer and on myself. For
                    instance, the NPC ships circling the player character are attached to one empty parent object in the
                    center which is scripted to rotate on its own axis. This helps in avoiding having multiple movement
                    scripts in the scene while still achieving the same gameplay experience.

                    The NPC fire rate varies between a fixed range based on the Player's Health State: higher the player
                    health, higher the fire rate.
                    The NPC rotation speed increases whenever the player hits an NPC rather than increasing over time.
                    These mechanics synchronise the game's difficulty level with the player's skill level to some
                    extent.
