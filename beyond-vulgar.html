                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The word "vulgar" comes from latin word "vulgaris" which means belonging of common people or of crowd - from the word "volgus" which means mob or common folk. The recorded meaning dates back to around 14th century, according to Etymonline.

                    By avoiding the use of "vulgar language" are you not pretending to be superior? In doing so, are you not conveying that you are not superior? are you not conveying that there should remain people who are inferior? are you not, by standing against vulgar language, enforcing people to remain in inferiority?
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    One who is firmly grounded in truly superior values would not be discomforted in using or doing that which the mediocre consider "vulgar."
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "Vulgar" refers to the common people or the majority. What may be considered "vulgar" changes as paradigms shift over time. As Nietzsche's lion abandons the values imposed by the dragon, one must abandon the contemporary mediocrity in order to liberate oneself.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The abandonment is not the liberation itself but a step towards liberation.

                    By merely avoiding a thing rather than overcoming it, you acknowledge its superiority over your fragile values.

                    Your physical body is as natural as water, land, air, and fire. Addressing your body in a derogatory way is an anti-value which was / is advanced by the christian church.

                    The British colonials stripped India of its cultures while replacing them with a system grounded in life-negation.

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Pornographos</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The English word "pornography" comes from the Greek words "pornÄ“" and "graphein" meaning "prostitute" and "to write" respectively. "Pornographos" may be translated as depection of prostitutes. It is important to acknowledge that the term "prostitute" carries different connotations across time and place just as the idea of democracy changes across time and place.

                    Ancient Greeks celebrated life-affirming values and human traits - a contrast to the life-negating system of the church.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Taking into consideration the truth that sex is a life-affirming act, one should prioritise to celebrate it. Taking into consideration that values and systems should be grounded in life-affirmation, one should prioritise percieving pornography as a medium that can help partners build a stronger bond rather than as something to be frowned upon as alleged by those incapable of sustaining healthy bonds.

                    You must build yourself in such a way that the thing you once abandoned would no longer hold superiority over you, and you would no longer cower as you once did in its presence.

                    Look at the things which are considered vulgar by the people in your time, and build yourself values and systems that can accomodate these so called vulgar things in such a way that they would not hinder your growth, rather support your growth and well-being.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Look at the things which are considered normal by the people in your time, and transcend said normal things, for they are the new vulgar.
