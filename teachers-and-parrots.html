                    Whales are less likely to die of cancer than humans are. Initially it was hypothesised that cancer is more likely to occur among whales since they have a higher number of cells. Upon researching, it was found that whales have a higher rate of gene mutation than other mammals, and so a better chance of possessing genes which suppress tumor. This was termed

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I grew up in many different cultures, among many different peoples that spoke different languages and dialects, prayed to different gods, ate different foods, and saw social relationships and the world very differently from each other. I mingled with everyone and learned from them many different world-views.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Many people, despite growing up in environments consisting of significant diversity, understand very little about each other or various world views. Some do not even understand well enough the contexts in which their culture was moulded.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    An ant mill is a phenomenon where a group of ants lose track of the pheromone they meant to follow and end up moving in circles following their own pheromone. This spiralling could last long enough that the ants would die of exhaustion.

                    When I was teaching at a school, a colleague invited me to read "christian" scriptures. One of his arguments was that they contained stories which help in "handling mischievous students." What he did not know was that Nietzsche's works shed light on why using "christian" scriptures is one of the most imcompetent things a teacher could do.

                    I asked him whether he read Quran, Baghavad Gita, or learned about Buddhism or any other systems. He was so excited about sharing the views imposed on him that he forgot to learn what he did not know.

                    You may consider information from diverse sources, especially the latest studies from experts in the field of psychology, but ultimately you should prioritise learning from your own experience since no two things (or people) are alike in every way, and since you should earn the wisdom to match with the knowledge you possess regarding present phenomenons which are not the same as those of the past.

                <p class="lh-lg ">
                    In late 2018, a macaw (parrot) called Jessie from Edmonton (England) sat on a roof for three days. When firefighters were called to help bring it down, it said "fuck off," and flew off to another roof (eventually went to its "owner")

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Teachers in the past were highly respected because they earned their knowledge and wisdom through experience and thorough contemplation. An average teacher in the present day is merely an employee that does not possess appropriately balanced wisdom or comprehensive knowledge of the things they impose on children by parroting the text in books which are written, edited, published, and sold by peoples each with different motives of their own.

                    A colleague shared with me a pseudo rorschach test - an image of multiple animal images stacked on top of each other with reduced opacity. More importantly, it was a file which had been shared many times on the internet and had its visual integrity violated. The idea was that whichever animal you noticed first would say what kind of person you likely were. Me being an artist, especially a surrealist, saw an image of a strange yet fascinating creature whose body parts came from different animals. When I told her what I first saw, she asked me why I could not "answer straight." She did not like the truth; she expected me to choose from the list she provided- to say that I was something that I was not.

                    A teacher that carefully balances their wisdom and knowldge would acknowledge when the ways in which they frame their questions turn out to be ineffective or useless.

                    When someone says that the world is/was in a specific way, and that it should be in a specific way in the future, they reduce the wholeness of the world into a mere representation using words, and thus skew reality from its pure form. A teacher ought to encourage their pupil to explore, learn on their own, and to reflect on what they learned.
