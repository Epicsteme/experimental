                    To like something, you must first be aware of its existence.

                    Pleasure-pain principle refers to the tendency to avoid pain or seek immediate pleasure.
                    When a student learns a subject, it is due to their interest in the subject or the fear of
                    punishment.
                    <br><br>
                    A student who scores high grades in a subject may not choose the same field at college or
                    career level if they are not interested in it.
                    <br><br>
                    Children are likely to grow interest in or follow the paths of their family members or friends due
                    to
                    frequent exposure.
                    <br><br>
                    To create interest in something, exposure is necessary. For example, to create interest in
                    robotics, engineers could be called to the school along with a piece of their technology to
                    demonstrate. Students
                    should be made to interact with the engineers and learn about their work. Alternatively, the
                    students could be taken to a robotics lab to show them the environment and what it's like to work
                    there.
                    <br><br>
                    You may also bring items to class and let students interact with them to create interest in related
                    field. For example, when a student uses a microscope, they may develop an interest in microbiology.
