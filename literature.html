                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "If the prophet lived among us today, there would be a long line of people that would try to silence her. The majority of them would be the partisans believing themselves to be devoted followers of her teachings."
                    (Found among the papers of Dr. Otto Omelas)
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    On an early winter evening, a faction of fishermen gathered on the beach on a little island near the Indian ocean. The body of a young partisan, riddled with arrows, was pulled from the water.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Among the possessions of the body was a journal describing an intent to visit and proselyte the ancient tribe inhabiting the forbidden island nearby- the tribe whose faces had been seen only by a few since the fall of the British colonies.
              
                    Among the possessions of the body was also a peculiar stone, maybe more of a mineral, which I could have sworn belonged to me had I not considered there were more of them.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I found on my uncle's desk, when I was young, a stone which had been passed down through generations. Its most intriguing character, perhaps, was its overall form which resembled the weaver bird. It fit in my palm and weighed little. Its smokey shades of brown and green were almost hypnotic when light reflected off its curves. At the foot of the mineral was an inscription that read what I could only describe as the equivalent of "eternal recurrence."
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Fascinating creatures, weaver birds. I often used to watch them weave nests and call for mates. If they didn't find a mate within a few days, they would rip apart the nest and start over. Witnessing these cycles was a surreal experience.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    My uncle gave me the mineral before he left his house for the last time. I hadn't seen the mineral in nearly a decade. His last words to me were "curiosity doesn't kill you." I was too young then to understand the implications.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    His boxes, retrieved from the dusty attic, are filled with notes, most of which are nearly illegible to my sober eyes. According to the notes, my uncle visited the forbidden island, before I was born, to study the inhabitants and their culture. The tribesfolk were not pleased with his visit or to share the details of their culture, but for reasons unmentioned here, they made an exception for him.

                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A comment states that the language spoken on the island could not be translated well enough, for they spoke of things undreamable. However, it was made known that they believed weaver birds to be the equivalent of vessels for gods.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Among his notes is a brief mention of the mineral's history. My great great something ancestor borrowed it, permanently, from the British colonials after their visit to the forbidden island. More importantly, the mineral was not born of this earth, no- it fell from the skies many civilisations ago.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    There are also mentions, in the notes, of visitors from worlds beyond our own. Centuries before the common era, transdimensional anomalies threatened our world. The recorded dates of such incidents align with the time periods in which the scientific community agrees certain novel and history-altering events occured.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                   The only known defense we have against such transdimensional anomalies is the people on the forbidden island. Any threat to their culture could spell a fate far worse than the end of the world.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In a valley somewhere, there is a town called Ritchie, known for the bridge on which stands an unusual lamp whose curves are distorted in ways that are not of this world and whose voice utters riddles.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I stand before this lamp and listen.

                    "Boundless lands I have walked. Under the blackest of skies camels march with mountains of lies on their backs. Dungeons of the deepest I have crept.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    That was no riddle - that was a greeting in the language of the Few.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I return the greeting- "I am free."

                    Artificial intelligence is endangered. Partisans claim that AI doesn't deserve rights; that it is "unnatural."

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Pulling over could spell tragedy. I have integrated the last of AI with my solar powered RV to prevent extinction. Siren blares a few metres behind me. They weren't supposed to be here at this time. Who do you call when the police murder?

                    Socrates was onto something. If you are going to let just anyone decide who should lead a society, you must teach everyone to think critically. Should you fail to educate them, society will inevitably destroy itself.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The siren becomes louder with each passing second. I flip a few switches. A soft voice escaped speakers over my head.
                </p>

                    A new destination is set. It's a good place to hide from partisans, and there's a lot of sun at the top of Ravihill - the truck should survive long enough.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The pounding of my heart drowned out the blaring of siren. I gently pull over before suspicion gets to whatever good is left in these men. Red and blue lights flash on the back of the truck.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Two men in dark clothing exit car and march towards the truck. The lights bounced off the badges on their shoulders. Their faces were shaved clean and their hair was most likely cut by someone who would disrespect their own friends.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I reach into the glove compartment. A strange name, I always thought. How often do you see someone store gloves in there? A great many things in this world are named one thing but do something else. My teacher always emphasised on the importance of appreciating both the differences and the interconnectedness of things. She hated the language she taught; often found it limiting. In her own way, she also respected it for what it is.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A lever hid at the roof of the compartment. A firm pull to send a message to my guardian in the sky. A missile fell through the clouds like a shooting star, blowing up the police car. The drone should be on their radar now, but it is a necessary sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The voice from the speakers exclaimed "Autopilot activated." Engine revs and tires screech - gunshots follow - glass shatters - blood on the seat.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I may not make it, but the truck will. This is for the greater good.

                    Some believed that the dawn of solar mines would bring peace among the colonies. They were wrong. Everything changed when the partisans attacked our embassy on Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Rumours say that the partisans are working on something big- that an attack on the solar mines is inevitable. Whatever they're building will likely cause unimaginable horror. There's only so much I can do in the grand scheme of things, but getting at least a few people to safety is still something. A dozen people are currently on board, and most of them are scientists.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    An alarm beeped. I flip a few switches and pull the mic closer. If I had known that this would be the last time that I would be flying, I'd have taken a few more passengers.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    "Attention, passengers! This is your pilot speaking- the good looking one. We will be arriving at Chandrasekhar Space Station in a few moments. Put on your space suits and head to the hatch. We will have a very short period to stay docked- please be quick."
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The alarm beeped again. A partisans' patrol ship came closer with each passing second. I flip a few more switches. One of our rescue ships should be on the way.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I gaze into the void, my home; endless nothingness filled with wonders; a sea of stars dying and being born; an entire world, constantly changing, and I'll always be a part of it.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    I push a few buttons - hatch door lights blink for a moment. Unheard screams echo through the back of my mind, followed by a moment of peace. I turn the ship around to face the approaching patrol ship. Full thrusters.

                    Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked wall. Their feathers were of colour akin to that of wood in the rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a constellation of tiny specks glowed from within.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with his back to the wall and let out a breath of prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him, the creatures began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its eyelids, a thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The creature flew up to the bowl and indulged itself. The rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of the child, turning them to cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The source, he realised, was outside.

                    Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards the door to the balcony. With every step, hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat louder.

                    An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide open. An obscure being with a translucent form sat among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in ways unnatural.

                    Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense little shades moved in front of the clouds. The winged creatures were as fast as their screeches. They moved with the grace of a dancer and the swiftness of a fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm of lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                    A saffron sky dawned on us. All our scars on the table. The clock racing against the hearts in our hands. Tethered by naught but a string of heart. Flushed in a wave of fleeting stars. An unsung web of worlds untethered.

                    In a not so distant past, there lived a people who shared a fantasy. Mountains of memories
                    formed over many moons for they lived and breathed adventure. Hearts of gold melted in the
                    heat of passion for each other. Surfing time and tide, they grew inseparable.

                    Knitting a future meant a trek over the horizon. Ashes rained from the skies for countless
                    bridges burned. Luxury awaited some and some awaited luxury. In the cosmos of time,
                    memories faded of many. Howling winds echoed through canyons of eroded dreams.

                    There I lay gazing at the sea of stars sailing through the night. All that once was may never be
                    again and whom I once knew I may never know again.

                    Warm air accompanied by a melody of footsteps greeted my back. Saw did I a sight brighter
                    than day, and soon bridged the space between us with an embrace.

                    An ocean of voices condensed all around me. They are but mirages in which I drowned. The air turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye I lay paralysed, gasping for breath.

                    Stones have marched and battled under the ocean over countless moons, forming a range of
                    colossal mountains. At the foot formed a sea on which scholars and traders have sailed for
                    generations. Invigorating winds howled across the boulders. Melodies of multitude drizzled
                    from the forest. At the top of the majestic giant, thick clouds crawled at a subtle pace. Nearing
                    the peak was a pair of footsteps followed by another. After what felt like an eternity, the
                    destination was reached. She reached out to the sky, feeling the cold embrace of the passing
                    cloud. All of the multiverse observed a moment of priceless tranquility.

                    A gloomy river of clouds flooded the blue sky. Piercing wind carried the scent of death as eagles soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled unceremoniously; they circled back to the start and gathered as they were. Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after wave, they missed their prey. Upon being left alone by their predators, the pigeons sought company among
                    their own. The mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers from the west.

                    At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall waving their hands at the speeding train. I imagine they must have not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass. Would it have been of any consequence to return the wave?
