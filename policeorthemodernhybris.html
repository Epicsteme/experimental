                        Stanford prison experiment </a>
                    was a psychological experiment (1971) where the participants had to act (or live) as guards and prisoners, and their behavior was studied. The experiment had to be terminated before the planned date because the "guards" harassed the "prisoners" and the whole scenario became too extreme for the parties involved.

                    Sometime around 2017, I got down at Park local station (Madras, a.k.a Chennai) to grab dinner while I was on my way home from college. After I bought dinner from the railway canteen, I waited for another train to arrive when I saw what looked like an ill homeless person in tattered clothes.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    This person walked up to the canteen counter and grabbed an empty plastic water cup. They did not try to drink from it nor run away with it. They took two steps away from the counter with the cup in their hand and stared into space for a while. A passenger snitched to a cop who was walking by. The cop abused the homeless person with a cane before taking away the empty plastic cup.

                    On an evening in 2022, two of my
                    students got into a conflict that
                    quickly turned physical. This was a
                    child that wanted to become a cop when
                    he grew up. I took this potential future
                    cop / MMA champion aside and told him
                    how he could have handled the situation
                    better and what he could do if something
                    similar happened again

                    I have witnessed a constructive change
                    in my students'
                    attitude and behaviour,
                    and I know that I made their world a
                    little bit better.
