              Research shows that free will might just be an illusion, because
              our brains make decisions before we even notice them.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              When people talk about free will, they usually mean the idea that
              they, as conscious individuals, can make choices on their own,
              without being completely controlled by outside forces or past
              events. It's the feeling that in any situation, they could have
              chosen differently if they really wanted to. Basically, it's that
              sense of saying, “I am the one making this decision.”
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Even though this belief feels natural, decades of research suggest
              that our conscious minds might not actually be the ones
              controlling our actions.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              One of the most well-known studies is Benjamin Libet's experiments
              from the 1980s. He measured brain activity called the “readiness
              potential” before participants moved their fingers. He found that
              this activity started about half a second before people said they
              had decided to move. This shows that the brain begins preparing an
              action before we are even aware we've made the choice.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In 2008, Soon and colleagues used brain scans to predict which
              button people would press 7 to 10 seconds before they even
              realized they had made the choice. It shows the brain starts
              leaning toward a decision long before we're consciously aware of
              it. A few years later, in 2013, Soon and colleagues showed the
              same thing happens with more complex decisions, like choosing
              whether to add or subtract numbers.

              Psychologist Daniel Wegner, in his 2002 book <em>The Illusion of
              Conscious Will</em>, argued that the feeling we're consciously in
              control of our actions can be misleading. In many experiments,
              people thought they were causing actions that were actually
              triggered or influenced by external factors. Wegner suggests that
              our consciousness often just takes credit for actions the brain
              has already started, giving us the sense of “I willed this” even
              though we weren't the true cause.

              Both classical physics and quantum physics challenge the idea of
              free will. Classical physics tells us that everything in the
              universe follows strict cause and effect, so if you could rewind
              time and everything was exactly the same, you would always make
              the same choices. That means your decisions aren't really “free”
              in the way we usually think. Quantum physics adds a little
              randomness at the tiniest levels, but randomness isn't the same as
              control. Just because something happens by chance doesn't mean
              you're actively choosing it. So whether the universe is
              predictable or a bit random, it still doesn't give us the kind of
              free will we usually imagine.
