                    This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. The theme was "chain reaction." This was the first time that I took part in a game jam, and it was also the first time that I worked with
                    a deadline as short as one week. I teamed up with JDR, a developer that I met in the Jam's Discord
                    server. We helped each other work on our own individual games rather than collaborate on a single
                    game due to the significant differences in our schedules.
                    We shared and bounced ideas off of each other, exchanged feedback, play-tested and helped polish
                    each other's games.

                    As it was the first time that I attempted to make a game under a week, I had no idea on how to
                    manage
                    my time effectively. JDR introduced me to Trello, which I used to prioritise the game mechanics and
                    plan out the development of the game. Most of the week was spent on polishing the level and fixing
                    bugs.

                    I implemented the core gameplay, pause menu, main menu, and uploaded a playable version before the
                    deadline.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    Designing a level was a rudimantary skill at the time. I looked up key-terms
                    relevant to the theme and found a few interesting results of random objects set in a
                    dominoes-like-effect. I thought that it would be cool to have a level in which all the platforms are
                    set in a chain reaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Though I used physics simulation for only some parts of the level, I managed
                    to maintain the appearance of a chain reaction throughout the level. As I was not yet experienced
                    enough with level designing, I could not build a bigger level or multiple levels. Using platforms
                    with diverse mechanics, I built one level which can be completed in approximately one minute.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    A large ball in the level was supposed to hit a pillar that would knock pillars over. However, when
                    the ball touched the first pillar,
                    it did not tip over in some playtest sessions. To fix this, I decreased the mass of
                    the pillars, increased the mass and the force of the ball, increased the torque on the
                    pillars by a reasonable amount to make sure that they would completely tip over but not spin like a
                    top.

                    The pillars now tip over as expected.
