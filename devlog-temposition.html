                <p class="gamedevlog">The participants of Secret Santa Jam 2020 write to each other anonymously and each
                    member
                    receives a letter
                    containing information regarding the interests of the writer. We had to develop a game that includes
                    something relevant to the interests of the writer.

                    The person who wrote to me offered a choice between a rhythm based game and a visually appealing
                    platformer.

                <p class="chapterhead">Inspiration</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">While researching platformers and rhythm games, I found a game called "140" where
                    the level and the
                    platforms are in sync with the background music. I wanted to try and make something similar.

                    This would include both the choices I was offered- rhythm based and visually appealing platformer.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    I teamed up with a music composer from the jam's discord server.
                    They communicated efficiently, produced quality music and delivered in a timely manner.

                <p class="chapterhead">Level Design</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">I chose to make a platformer rather than something like Rhythm Heaven Fever since
                    I wanted to improve
                    my skill in designing platformer levels.

                    Though this game does not have a spectacular level design, I did learn a few new things and set a
                    direction for the improvement of my skills.

                <p class="chapterhead">Templates</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">I created a behaviour script that I used as a template for most of the platforms.
                    The values for
                    movement speed, start position and end position were manually entered for each platform after
                    attaching the script.

                <p class="chapterhead">Effects & Details</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">A subtle detail that I added to the audio visualiser is that each bar has a
                    different set of values:
                    the sensitivity and maximum height of the bars in the higher difficulty areas are higher than that
                    of the bars in the lower difficulty areas of the level.
                </p>

                <p class="chapterhead">The Catch</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">The audio visualiser flashes random colours in sync with the beats. This may be a
                    potential trigger
                    for those who suffer from epilepsy or have health conditions that are triggered by bright flashing
                    lights.

                    I added a clear warning of the flashing lights in both the download page as well as in the main menu
                    of the game. In retrospect, I realise that I should have added an option to disable the flashing of
                    the visualiser, and display the warning in the loading screen as well.
